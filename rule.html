                <p style="text-align: justify;">Taekwondo, often translated as "the way of the foot and fist," is a traditional Korean martial art that 
                    emphasizes kicking techniques, hand strikes, and jumps. <br> <br> It is a disciplined form of self-defense that goes 
                    beyond physical combat, incorporating mental and ethical principles. Taekwondo is not just about the physical
                     aspects, it also focuses on fostering character development, discipline, and respect.</p>

                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Taekwondo competitions are governed by a set of rules and regulations designed to ensure fair play and safety. Matches are typically
                     scored based on successful kicks and strikes that land with precision and power. Points are awarded for kicks to the head and body, 
                     with more points given for more challenging techniques. <br> <br> But there are several illegal moves in Taekwondo you have to avoid, such as
                      striking below the belt, hitting the back of the head, and using excessive force. Matches are overseen by referees, and competitors
                       are required to wear protective gear, including helmets and chest protectors. These rules contribute to the strategic and
                        disciplined nature of Taekwondo competitions.</p>
